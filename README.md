# MathGames
I build this project as part of individual real projects to face some new challenges with React Native.
The project containq some fun games to play (currently there's only one) using the latest tools availible with react native
I may not pay much attention to the design, but i focused more on the back-end of the app and tried my best to make it as optimized as possible
and maybe a reference to anybody who wants to see how some parts work with each other.
Please report any bug you face, and most important share your thoughts with me. Thank you.
